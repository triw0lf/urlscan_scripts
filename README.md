# urlscan_scripts
A bunch of scripts I use to work with urlscan.io

You will need:
1. URLScan API (https://urlscan.io/about-api/)
2. jq (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) (https://jqplay.org/)

For a sample of execution of urlscan_badfiles.sh - https://www.laurenproehl.com/blog/2019/9/9/urlscan-file-grab
